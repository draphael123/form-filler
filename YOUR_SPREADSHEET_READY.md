## Available Columns in Your Spreadsheet

Your converted file includes these columns (and more):

## Tips

1. **Column names** will appear in the mapping dropdown
2. **Match PDF fields** to the appropriate column (e.g., PDF field "Provider Name" → "Name")
3. **Skip fields** you don't need by leaving them unmapped
4. **Test with one provider** first to verify the mapping works

## File Location

The converted file is saved in your project folder:
